## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Scraper (Python)**
    
    - Extracts the top 50 games from [Steam‚Äôs Top Sellers](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers).
    - Retrieves price data via Steam‚Äôs API.
    - Saves the data to `notification.json`.
2. **GitHub Actions**
    
    - Runs the scraper **daily** at 12:00 UTC or 17:00ET.
    - After the scrapper script finish and generates the `notification.json`, this triggers the discord action to post the message to a channel.
